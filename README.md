# Instagram Image Retrieve

This is a simple JavaScript function for retrieving Instagram images based on a username or hashtag.

When Instagram closed its API in June 2016, I had to sunset some parts of an app I was building that displayed the most recent images for an account or hashtag.

This function retrieves the web page, gets the URLs of the images and returns them (along with other metadata).
